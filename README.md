# TicTacToe

Define the game board and the different possible moves.
The game board for tic-tac-toe is a 3x3 grid. There are 9 possible moves, one for each of the squares on the grid.

Implement the minimax algorithm.
The minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm that works by first considering all possible moves that the computer player can make. For each move, the algorithm then considers all possible moves that the human player can make in response. This process is repeated until the game reaches a terminal state, at which point the algorithm can calculate the score for that state.

The minimax algorithm will choose the move that results in the highest score for the computer player.

Implement the evaluation function.
The evaluation function is a function that assigns a score to each board state. The score reflects the likelihood that the computer player will win, lose, or draw from that board state.

User Interface 
The command line itself is used as UI . The margins and labels are smartly defined using equal spacing and headings.
